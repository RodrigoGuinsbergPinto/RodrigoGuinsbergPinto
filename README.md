Hello everyone. I'm Rodrigo, front-end web developer student at HackYourFuture-DK, where for the last 8 months I have been acquiring the necessary skills to become a web developer.

With determination, Rodrigo has been sharpening his skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and mastering Git and GitHub for version control, as well as recently exploring the world of React.

In addition, Rodrigo is also exploring back-end development, gaining experience with NodeJs and database using MySQL.

Rodrigo is Brazilian and is currently living in Copenhagen-DK.

Rodrigo is a family guy who loves the sea, outdoor activities, and cooking for family and friends.
